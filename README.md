# STM32Cube-firmware-based-projects-launcher

This is a template application for the STM32 ARM microcontrollers that compiles with GNU tools (arm-none-eabi toolchain).  It serves as a quick-start for Linux fans and those who do not prefer using IDE, but rather develop in a text editor of choice and build from the command line.

The project is Edited for an STM32F401RE and loaded using GNU toolchain and st-link.
